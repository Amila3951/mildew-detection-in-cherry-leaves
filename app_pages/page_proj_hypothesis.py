        "Our hypothesis is that cherry leaves infected with powdery mildew will exhibit "
        "distinguishable visual characteristics, such as discoloration or texture changes, "

        "To validate our hypothesis, we will follow these steps:\n\n"
        "1. **Visual Exploration:** Analyze images of healthy and infected leaves to identify potential visual cues.\n"
        "2. **Machine Learning:** Train a model to classify leaves as healthy or infected based on image data.\n"
        "3. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.\n"
        "4. **Analysis:** Investigate any misclassifications to understand limitations and potential areas for improvement."

        "it can be challenging to reliably distinguish between healthy and infected leaves based on visual inspection alone. "
